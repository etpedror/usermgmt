# Simple Modules to help with some Azure operations
This set of powershell scripts is meant to automate some tasks on Azure.  
It is still a work in progress, but the main goal is to have a set of tools that make it simple to perform some normal tasks (like rotating passwords), either on the console or as part of a pipeline
